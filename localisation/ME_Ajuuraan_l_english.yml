 #Events 
 ME_Ajuuraan_Events.1.t: "Imports from Asia" 
 ME_Ajuuraan_Events.1.d: "It has been a while since we found the great Eastern Empire. Our merchants began to establish trade from Malacca to the coasts of China. The newly-established trade system imported exquisite goods from the empire, most especially ceramics with beautiful designs, elegant silks, and strong spices. However, it is not just goods that flowed from the trade. Eunuchs and slaves became part of trading as well. It is not surprising that the slaves are striving for their liberty. The eunuchs, on the other hand, are proved to be useful. They offer service and loyalty to their masters. Chinese traders are rarely flocking to our nation to seek new environments and opportunities for their prestige. " 
 ME_Ajuuraan_Events.1.a: "We will request their finest celadon wares." 
 ME_Ajuuraan_Events.1.b: "Let us import Spice, the flavor of life."
 ME_Ajuuraan_Events.1.c: "Import silk worms to weave the finest of silk fabrics!"
 ME_Ajuuraan_Events.1.e: "We need not foreign imports in our court."
 
 ME_Ajuuraan_Events.2.t: "Prosperity of Pate" 
 ME_Ajuuraan_Events.2.d: "Victory! We have consolidated the lands beyond the south! We must celebrate by reestablishing the city of Pate. It had reached such an old and pitiful state after few centuries from its foundation. Its foundation can be traced back approximately 700 years after the Hijra by a group of Omanis. As the destined nation in the south, we must reestablish the city and make its way returning to its former glory! Immigrants and merchants are welcome to inhabit the restored city!" 
 ME_Ajuuraan_Events.2.a: "Let the city and its inhabitants prosper!" 

 ME_Ajuuraan_Events.3.t: "Mnara and Mandhry Mosques" 
 ME_Ajuuraan_Events.3.d: "As we slowly conquer our southern neighbors, we realized that even their previous sultans failed to handle their duties. Even a large portion of their citizens don't seem to worship Allah. Instead, they turn to their pantheon of deities who don't provide enlightenment to their people. It is our duty as a nation led by a teacher to teach these infidels the words of the Qur'an. Let us build mosques far grander than their monuments and make them fall to their knees, worshipping only the One True God. Otherwise, we can ignore them for now and practice goodwill towards them and use the money for something else." 
 ME_Ajuuraan_Events.3.a: "Repair and transform them!"
 ME_Ajuuraan_Events.3.b: "We will spend our money elsewhere"

 ME_Ajuuraan_Events.4.t: "Influx of Ming Migrants" 
 ME_Ajuuraan_Events.4.d: "It's been some time that we have established our relationship with the Great Ming. People from their realm migrate to our nation, seeking asylum, finding a better way of life, and pursuing the knowledge we possess. Some of them even got accustomed to our culture and converted to Islam! Perhaps we must make use of these foreigners, let them enter the court, and increase their influence so that they will offer us better service. Otherwise, we must be wary of them and treat them as we treat our citizens." 
 ME_Ajuuraan_Events.4.a: "They shall be treated as our citizens, equal in merit and opportunity!" 
 ME_Ajuuraan_Events.4.b: "We would best curve such influences."

 ME_Ajuuraan_Events.5.t: "The Ming Imperial Envoy" 
 ME_Ajuuraan_Events.5.d: ""Great Imam, An envoy had delivered us a message, directly from the emperor himself!" said one of the Imam's advisors, beside him, the imperial envoy. The advisor announced these words, "The Imperial Majesty demands our submission and swear fealty to him. Tributes must be delivered once a year. Through the Emperor's goodwill, he offers us boons and eternal friendship for the betterment of both our nations. Otherwise, so be it, our budding friendship shall be void. I will only offer you this only once, and I will offer you this opportunity no longer.". A wave of silence swept the room, and moments later, the Imam declared. . ." 
 ME_Ajuuraan_Events.5.a: "Let us intertwine the legacies and fates of our two countries!" 
 ME_Ajuuraan_Events.5.b: "Our sovereignty cannot be undermined!" 

 ME_Ajuuraan_Events.6.t: "Confucianism in Ajuuraan" 
 ME_Ajuuraan_Events.6.d: "As flocks of these Easterners settled in our country, they brought along their culture, and most importantly, their religion. Confucianism showed us a religion centered solely on morality and wisdom. It is a wise choice to introduce this religion and make it ours, bringing stability to our holy state. However, should we abandon the One True God? He who commanded birth to this nation?" 
 ME_Ajuuraan_Events.6.a: "Confucius is a wise compass, we shall heed his teachings."
 ME_Ajuuraan_Events.6.b: "This is hubris and blasphemy!"
