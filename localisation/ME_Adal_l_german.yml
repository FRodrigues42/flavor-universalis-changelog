Based on reference to Yusuf Al Kawneyn in the Harar manuscripts, it is believed that Al-Kawneyn was the founder and ancestor of the Walashma dynasty that governed both Sultanate of Ifat and Adal Sultanate during the middle ages. Another tradition suggests that Aw Barkhadle was a descendant of Ismail Sheikh Isaaq ibn Ahmed."

 ME_Adal_Events.2.t: "Legacy of a Fallen Empire"

While it may be treason of the highest order, we could allow them to overthrow our government and perhaps, the era of instability may finally end." 
 ME_Adal_Events.3.a: "We will not engage in unnecessary bloodshed."
 ME_Adal_Events.3.b: "The House of Walashama fears no foe!"
