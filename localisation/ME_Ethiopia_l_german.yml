The church he founded is under persecution in Egypt but still stands strong in Ethiopia to this day. We are one of the last few bastions of this faith, and as such, we must take on the mantle of the defenders of the Coptic Faith, and protect our brothers and sisters from foreign powers, that tried for centuries to submit them and forcefully convert them."

 ME_Ethiopia_Events.2.d: "At the time Zara Yaqob assumed the throne, the Ethiopian Church had been divided over the issue of Biblical Sabbath observance for roughly a century. One group, loyal to the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, believed that the day of rest should be observed only on Sunday, or Great Sabbath. Another group, the followers of Ewostatewos, believed with their founder that both the original seventh-day Sabbath (i.e., Saturday, or Lesser Sabbath) and Sunday should be observed.\n\nHe was successful in persuading two recently-arrived Egyptian Abuna, Mikael and Gabriel, into accepting a compromise aimed at restoring harmony with the Ewostathians. At the same time, he made efforts to pacify the House of Ewostatewos. While the Ewostathians were won over to the compromise by 1442, the two Abuns only agreed to the compromise at the Council of Debre Mitmaq in Tegulet."
 ME_Ethiopia_Events.2.a: "A compromise can be reached."
